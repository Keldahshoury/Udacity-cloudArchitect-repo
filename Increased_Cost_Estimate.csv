Ive incresed the storage of the cloud front for every region and incresed the number of requests in the larger regions. I increased the amount of storage in the Main RDS as well as in the read replica and I added glacial storage and lens objects into the S3 bucket to allow for more cost effective long term storgae. Finally i added outbound and inbound storage to my VPC and incresed the days available.,,,,,,,,
